Concentration
=============
This is a simple implementation of the basic logic in the game [Concentration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)) in Lua, using the cross-platform MOAI SDK.

Run the source of this game with [MOAI SDK](http://getmoai.com/sdk/moai-sdk-download.html)

I stopped at the core logic, and didn't even add winning or any sort of UI embellishments such as score. I'll come back to it sometime in 2014, maybe in the summer, but I have much larger things to work on now.

This is mainly just up so people can see the power of MOAI, and check the code out to see how some things are done.
